# AdamTrepac
🌟 Introduction
I am Adam Trepáč, a Business Informatics student at Masaryk University focused on the intersection of data, technology, and core business processes. This repository serves as a portfolio of Python projects and algorithms, demonstrating foundational coding skills, logical problem-solving, and a specialization in enterprise software concepts.

🛠️ Project Highlights & Technical CompetenciesThe projects are organized into thematic folders. The complexity demonstrated here is foundational to understanding larger enterprise systems.
1. Algorithms and Data Structures (/algorithms)
Project,Concept Demonstrated,Relevance to Business
Binary Search Tree,"Pointers, recursion, efficient data searching (O(h) complexity), and data validation.","Data Organization & Validation: Foundational structure for managing hierarchical data (e.g., organizational charts, general ledgers)."
Graph Algorithms (BFS/DFS),"Breadth-First Search (Queue), Depth-First Search (Stack/Recursion), and graph traversal.","Process Optimization & Routing: Core logic for finding the shortest path (e.g., supply chain optimization) or network flow analysis."
